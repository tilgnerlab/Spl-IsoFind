# Spatial Isoform Finder

This GitHub can be used to detect spatially variable isoforms in long-read spatial transcriptomics data. For now it only contains demo data and Python scripts, but a Python package with proper tutorials will follow soon.

One can create a conda environment with all packages required to run the Spl-IsoFind code using the following argument:

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
